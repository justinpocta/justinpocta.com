# Hello!

One of my major passions is applying my design skills toward the refinement and clarity of a digital project's experience. My obsession with constantly learning more has led me, project-by-project, to being increasingly human-centered in my process and what I see as necessary for an app or website to be truly _successful_. Helping useful tools become more enjoyable and easier to understand is what I strive to do.

I love working with teams that value asking questions. _Why are we creating a given project? What is the objective and our goal? How could we achieve it differently, better, smarter, faster? What if we tried it another way?_

<i class="fas fa-comments" style="float:left; font-size:60px; padding-right:16px;"></i> I'd love [**get in touch**](mailto:howdy@justinpocta.com?subject=Hello) about full-time opportunities for Product Designer/UX roles!
