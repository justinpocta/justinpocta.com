One of my major passions is applying my design skills toward the refinement and clarity of a digital project's experience. My obsession with constantly learning more has led me, project-by-project, to being increasingly human-centered in my process and what I see as necessary for an app or website to be truly _successful_. Helping useful tools become more enjoyable and easier to understand is what I strive to do.

I love working with teams that value asking questions. _Why are we creating a given project? What is the objective and our goal? How could we achieve it differently, better, smarter, faster? What if we tried it another way?_

## EVOLVING PROCESS FLOW

As teams grow and merge and transform, how we work together often needs to change. I lean toward communication and flexibility, but find flows helpful to understand common needs expectations.

Strategy as a means of recognizing the **past** and **present** as you identify the best plan for the **future**, adjusting the sails as winds and unexpected events occur along the way and maybe even need to reroute courses to something more suitable or better.

## **A LITTLE MORE ABOUT MYSELF**

After a few years in Brooklyn, NY, my wife and I moved back to our hometown of Dallas, TX. Alongside design, I am presently nerding out about building a [UX Zettelkasten](http://zk.justinpocta.com/), cities and [urbanism](http://urbanist.justinpocta.com/), [biking in cities](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLecJQW4DoGw2qD7qdsbRGzwz53QF9IBM7), [tech reviews on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLecJQW4DoGw2Xt7280WJyVpt9D-FtrbGH), watercolor, creating [libraries](http://library.justinpocta.com/), taking too many photographs, and constantly learning more about how things work.
