One of my major passions is applying my design skills toward the refinement and clarity of a digital project's experience. My obsession with constantly learning more has led me, project-by-project, to being increasingly human-centered in my process and what I see as necessary for an app or website to be truly _successful_. Helping useful tools become more enjoyable and easier to understand is what I strive to do.

I love working with teams that value asking questions. _Why are we creating a given project? What is the objective and our goal? How could we achieve it differently, better, smarter, faster? What if we tried it another way?_

## **A LITTLE MORE ABOUT MYSELF**

I've bounced back and forth between NYC and Dallas. Alongside design, I am presently nerding out about building a [UX Zettelkasten](http://zk.justinpocta.com/), obsessing over cities and [urbanism](http://urbanist.justinpocta.com/), [biking with my GoPro](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLecJQW4DoGw2qD7qdsbRGzwz53QF9IBM7), [reviewing tech on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLecJQW4DoGw2Xt7280WJyVpt9D-FtrbGH), and dabbling with watercolor.
