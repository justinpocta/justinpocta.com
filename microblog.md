# microblog

- **202208032329** I'm launching my Github Pages account to my domain. I've been shipping people off to my Figma portfolio but know it's a bit rough having people redirect as soon as they arrive on my domain. This at least will give people some context and I'll just keep pushing refinements as I decide what I want to do with this site.

 - **202208032327** In exciting consumer news, I bought a 30oz mug for drinking water and I'm very happy with my purchase for staying hydrated all day. That's it. That's the tweet.

- **202208032323** I got my landing page running locally on my computer now, so I can modify the CSS more easily. The process of trying to make it work showed me I still have a lot to figure out with Ruby/RVM/installation. I never paid attention to Github Pages beyond the markdown factor, but I'm excited to use it as a way to learn more about Jekyll. I also realized I can easily control my URLs, so I'm merging my "microblog"/Notes pages into this same repo which will reduce my toggling back and forth. 

- **202208022109** Yesterday, I finally cracked the code last night. Lots of wild hacks that I barely understood, but it works! For now. If it breaks, I probably need to move to a newer generator than I am using, but for now it is working well enough for me to customize the UI and edit the templates. While I'm not a hardcore developer, it is really satisfying manipulating code and seeing it actually work. I missed it. **Bring back the 2000s!** Social media took away the fun of the internet and I want it back. üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- **202208011150** I was making a lot of progress, started to dive into some [Jekyll-based](https://nextjs.org) static site generators (didn't know it was such a thing!). And then I hit a huge wall with localhost setup so I can stop having to repetively do git push to test things. Love when that happens. It's been fun though, figuring out little puzzles and customizing pages to work with a few ideas I have. Good for the soul to create. _Side note:_ I had a dream last night where someone used mayonaisse to create a sculpture of the Queen of England (it turned out surprisingly realistic) to distract a crowd of reporters by driving off in a 1920s convertible with 'her' in the back. I would be willing to sell this brilliant idea to Hollywood's next blockbuster for 1 million dollars.

- **202207281831** Today, I came across a cool, minimalistic inspiration app called [SAVEE](https://savee.it). I've been using [Dropmark](https://justinpocta.dropmark.com) for a bit now and am getting into the idea of building out a new version of my site with lots of resources spaces with similar apps plugged into subdomains.

- **202207281826** I started a [Zettelkasten](http://zettelkasten.de) sort of a notes system via Obsidian last night to sort out my thoughts and things I'm learning lately. Now that I'm getting the hang of what Github Pages can do, I may start to dive more into Jekyll and figure out if I can get a linked notes system together. Maybe I need another kind of plugin/tool for that. Basically thinking it'd be fun to build out a collection of interlinking ideas, help to see possibilities and concepts better. Obsidian is great as it is, especially pulled aside into a focused space, but having it as a website would be more fun to just share. Just not sure I want to put in the monthly fee for it. As I'm diving into UX Strategy and UX Process materials lately, it helps to use my simple, interlinking Obsidian as flash cards, to keep sharpening my understanding and approach to my work and remind myself of the things I'm taking in and how I'm processing them.

- **202207270600** Thinking about how to leave social, but still, like, exist. Flickr Pro could be a way to dodge ads and still post and all that sort of fun. I miss the old internet. Great. I'm that old now, I guess. Hard to break free. I've been with Instagram since very early into its creation before it became such a thing. I've been reducing my usage, have had it off of my homescreen for quite some time now. Still not totally sure, but maybe setting up camp outside of these apps will help me to begin to make a new space to belong and think and write and share. We'll see.
